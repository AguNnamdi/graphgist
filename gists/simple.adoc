= The simplest GraphGist

This http://neo4j.org[Neo4j] GrgaphGist shows the basics of using http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/[AsciiDoctor] syntax and a few additions for GraphGists, namely +//console+ for a live console, and +//table1+, +//graph1+ and +//output1+ comment elements to visualize queries with the corresponding number. 

Click on the upper navbar to see the source for this Gist.
